# Skyhanni Pride Flags

Be proud of who you are!

 - German
 - Persian
 - Romanian
 - Bisexual
 - Transsexual

Simply install this texture pack and have skyhanni installed and your chroma will be replaced with our custom colors.

By default this uses the bisexual flag, but you can change it by running the accompanying python script: 
```
python assets/skyhanni/shaders/edit-flag.py germany.txt
```

Then just reload your texture packs in game and you are good to go. (Note that this only works if you unpacked your texture pack, and you need to have python installed)

Also skyhanni might not have my pr yet that allows you to reload shaders, so you might need to restart for your change to work.
